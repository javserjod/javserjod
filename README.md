## Welcome to my pageðŸ‘‹
I'm Javier Serrano Jodral, graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering and with a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on data and software.
While pursuing a first job or internship, I keep acquiring new knowledge in the field and enhancing all my abilities everyday.
Here I attach some of the projects I've been working on by myself for the last few years, including my final thesis for both Bachelor and Master's Degree.
